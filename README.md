# Getting Started with Discord Bot in Go ![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/ryokacchi/discord-go) ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ryokacchi/discord-go)
This project is designed to enhance my proficiency in Go and to provide a practical understanding of the fundamentals involved in building a Discord bot using the [discord-go](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) library. It serves as a powerful and flexible foundation for developing advanced Discord bots.

## Installation
First of all, to run this project, your computer must have [Go version 1.24.2](https://go.dev/) installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/ryokacchi/discord-go
```
After creating the necessary files to specify the database key, and token fill them in by referring to the example folders.

```ini
[bot]
token = ""

[database]
uri = "mongodb://localhost:27017"
```
